Using Bcfg2 With CentOS
=======================

This section covers specific topics for using Bcfg2 with CentOS. Most
likely the tips on this page also apply to other members of the Red Hat
family of Linux operating systems.

From Source
+++++++++++

Install Prerequisities
######################

While you can go about building all these things from source, this
how to will try and meet the dependencies using packages from EPEL_
or RPMforge_. The *el5* package should be compatible with CentOS 5.x.

EPEL_ for 5.x ::
    [root@centos ~]# rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

EPEL_ for 6.x ::
    [root@centos ~]# rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm

RPMforge_ for 5.x ::

    [root@centos ~]# rpm -Uvh http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.x86_64.rpm

.. note::

    Be careful with `mixing package repositories
    <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#What_about_compatibility_with_other_third_party_repositories.3F>`_.

Now you can install the rest of the prerequisites::

    [root@centos ~]# yum install python-genshi python-cheetah python-lxml

Build Packages from source
##########################

* After installing git, clone the master branch::

    [root@centos redhat]# git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/bcfg2.git

* Install the ``fedora-packager`` package ::

    [root@centos ~]# yum install fedora-packager

* A directory structure for the RPM build process has to be established. ::

    [you@centos ~]$ rpmdev-setuptree

* Change to the *redhat* directory of the checked out Bcfg2 source::

    [you@centos ~]$ cd bcfg2/redhat/

* In the particular directory is a Makefile which will do the job of building the RPM packages. You can do this as root, but it's not recommended::

    [you@centos redhat]$ make

* Now the new RPM package can be installed.  Please adjust the path to your RPM package::

    [root@centos ~]# rpm -ihv /home/YOU/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/bcfg2-server-1.0.0-0.2r5835.noarch.rpm

Install Packages from Package repository
########################################

To install the bcfg2-server and bcfg2 from a package repository, just
use Yum to do it::

    [root@centos ~]# yum install bcfg2-server bcfg2
