Bcfg2 Development
=================

There are many ways to get involved in Bcfg2 development. Here we will
outline some things that can help you get familiar with the various
areas of the Bcfg2 code.


Send patches to the :ref:`help-mailinglist` or create a trac
`ticket <https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/newticket>`_
with the patch included. In order to submit a ticket via the
trac system, you will need to create a session by clicking on the
`Preferences <https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/prefs>`_ link and
filling out/saving changes to the form. In order to be considered for
mainline inclusion, patches need to be BSD licensed. The most convenient
way to prepare patches is by using ``git diff`` inside of a source tree
checked out of git.

The source tree can be checked out by running::

    git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/bcfg2.git

Users wishing to contribute on a regular basis can apply for direct
git access. Mail the :ref:`help-mailinglist` for details.
