    client
        A system that runs the :command:`bcfg2` command. Typically, this
        is to receive a configuration from a Bcfg2 server.

    generator
        A type of plugin which provides file contents. For example
        :ref:`server-plugins-generators-cfg` or
        :ref:`server-plugins-generators-tgenshi-index`.

    Genshi
        A Python-based templating engine. `Genshi Homepage`_.

    group
        A "tag" assigned to a client through a probe or other plugin.

    irc channel
        #bcfg2 on freenode

    probe
        A script that executes on a client machine and sets client
        metadata such as group membership.

    profile
        A special type of group that a client is explicitly assigned to.

    repository
        A collection of folders and files that together define the
        configurations that Bcfg2 applies to clients. The repository
        is located at :file:`/var/lib/bcfg2` by default. This is not
        to be confused with a :term:`VCS` repository, which is an
        excellent place to pull your Bcfg2 repository from to manage
        changes. When used alone, :term:`repository` refers to a Bcfg2
        repository.

    VCS
        Stands for `Version Control System
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>`_.
