Distribution-specific notes
===========================

The installation of Bcfg2 on a specific distribution depends on the
package management tool and the availability of the package in the
distribution's repository.

Alpine Linux
============

Packages for `Alpine Linux`_ are available in the `testing`_ repository.
Just use `apk` to perform the installation ::

   apk add bcfg2 bcfg2-server -U -X http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/ --allow-untrusted

.. _Alpine Linux: http://www.alpinelinux.org/
.. _testing: http://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/tree/testing/bcfg2

ArchLinux
=========

Packages for `Arch Linux`_ are available in the Arch User Repository (AUR_).
Just use `pacman` to perform the installation ::

   pacman -S bcfg2 bcfg2-server

.. _Arch Linux: http://www.archlinux.org/
.. _AUR: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20979

Debian
======

Packages of Bcfg2 are available for Debian Lenny, Debian Squeeze, and
Debian Sid. The fastest way to get Bcfg2 onto your Debian system
is to use ``apt-get`` or ``aptitude``. ::

   sudo aptitude install bcfg2 bcfg2-server

If you want to use unofficial packages from Bcfg2 see the instructions
at `CustomDebianRepository`_.

Fedora
======

The fastest way to get Bcfg2 packages onto your Fedora_ system is to
use `yum` or PackageKit. Yum will pull in all dependencies of Bcfg2
automatically. ::

    su -c 'yum install bcfg2-server bcfg2'

Be aware that the latest release of Bcfg2 may only be available for the
Development release of Fedora (Rawhide).  With the activation of the
Rawhide repository of Fedora you will be able to install it. ::

    su -c 'yum install --enablerepo=rawhide bcfg2-server bcfg2'

This way is not recommended on production systems. Only for testing.

Gentoo
======

Early in July 2008, Bcfg2 was added to the Gentoo portage tree. So far
it's still keyworded for all architectures, but we are actively working
to get it marked as stable.

If you don't use portage to install Bcfg2, you'll want to make sure you
have all the prerequisites installed first. For a server, you'll need:

* ``app-admin/gamin`` or ``app-admin/fam``
* ``dev-python/lxml``

Clients will need at least:

* ``app-portage/gentoolkit``

OS X
====

Bcfg2 can be installed either via MacPorts or by creating a native OS X
package.

MacPorts
--------

Once macports is installed::

    port install bcfg2

Using native OS X python
------------------------

First, make sure you have Xcode installed as you need ``packagemaker`` which
comes bundled in the Developer tools.

Clone the git source::

    git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/bcfg2.git

Change to the osx directory and type make. Your new package should be
located at ``bcfg2-$VERSION.pkg`` (where ``$VERSION`` is that which is
specified in ``setup.py``).

RHEL / Centos / Scientific Linux
================================

While you can go about building all these things from source, this
section will try and meet the dependencies using packages from EPEL_
[#f1]_. The *el5* and the *el6* package should be compatible
with `CentOS`_ 5.x/6.x and `Scientific Linux`_.

EPEL_ for 5.x ::
    [root@centos ~]# rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

EPEL_ for 6.x ::
    [root@centos ~]# rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm

Install the bcfg2-server and bcfg2 RPMs::

    [root@centos ~]# yum install bcfg2-server bcfg2

.. note::

    The latest package for *el5* is only available in the testing repository.

Ubuntu
======

We highly recommend following the instructions at `ubuntu-installation`_
in order to install a recent version of Bcfg2 on your system. However,
if you would like to install the older package, you can use the following
command::

   sudo aptitude install bcfg2 bcfg2-server
