============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bcfg2-reports` [-a] [-b <NAME>] [-c] [-d] [-e <NAME>] [-h] [-m <NAME>]
[-s <NAME>] [-x <NAME>] [--badentry=<KIND,NAME>]
[--extraentry=<KIND,NAME>] [--fields=<ARG1,ARG2,...>]
[--modifiedentry=<KIND,NAME>] [--sort=<ARG1,ARG2,...>] [--stale] [-v]

## DESCRIPTION

`bcfg2-reports` allows you to retrieve data from the database about
clients, and the states of their current interactions. It also allows
you to change the expired/unexpired states. The utility runs as a
standalone application. It does, however, use the models from
`/src/lib/Server/Reports/reports/models.py`.

## OPTIONS

  * `-a`:
    Specify alternate bcfg2.conf location

  * `-b` <hostname>:
    Single host mode - shows bad entries from the current interaction of

  * `-c`:
    Shows only clean hosts.

  * `-d`:
    Shows only dirty hosts.

  * `-e` <hostname>:
    Single host mode - shows extra entries from the current interaction
    of *hostname*.

  * `-h`:

  * `-x` <hostname>:
    Toggles expired/unexpired state of *hostname*.

  * `--badentry=`<entry type, entry name>:
    Shows only hosts whose current interaction has bad entries of type
    *entry type* and name *entry name*. If a single argument ARG1 is

  * `--extraentry=`<entry type, entry name>:
    Shows only hosts whose current interaction has extra entries of type
    *entry type* and name *entry name*. If a single argument ARG1 is

    of name ARG1.

  * `--fields=`<ARG1,ARG2,...>:
    Only displays the fields *ARG1,ARG2,...* (name, time, state, total,
    good, bad).

  * `--modifiedentry=`<entry type, entry name>:
    Shows only hosts whose current interaction has modified entries of
    type *entry type* and name *entry name*. If a single argument ARG1
    is given, then *entry type*,*entry name* pairs will be read from a
    file of name ARG1.

  * `--sort=`<ARG1,ARG2,...>:
